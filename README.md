#Welcome to the HMC FabStudio Eagle Library!  

Here, you'll find a library of commonly-used parts, as well as parts that   
we can find both in the stock room and the FabStudio.  

If you're new to creating parts in Eagle, take a look here.  

## Eagle Tricks:  
[Defining GND on multiple pins] (http://dangerousprototypes.com/2012/05/30/how-to-create-eagle-parts-with-pins-that-have-the-same-name/)  
[Printing a Bill of Materials] (http://www.cs.uml.edu/teams-academy/index.php/AT/Bom)

To copy a part, symbol, or package from another library, simply open the 
library you want to add to, open the Eagle control panel, browse for your part 
of choice in the existing libraries, right click it, and add it to your 
library. 

Let's take some pride in our work here, and create something long-lasting!
